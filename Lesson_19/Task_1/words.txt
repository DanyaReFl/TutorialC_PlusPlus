Given that Norse myths and texts were repressed and persecuted under Christian rule,
relatively few have survived into the modern day. However, some of these tales were
recorded by Christian scholars, particularly in the Prose Edda and the Heimskringla by
Snorri Sturluson (1178-1241 C.E.), who believed that pre-Christian deities were men and
women rather than devils (and would thus reveal elements of their respective culture's histories).
Sturluson, who was a leading poet, chieftain, and diplomat in Iceland, condensed the extensive
sagas into prose retellings that made the various tales of Norse mythology systematic and coherent.
An additional source for the modern understanding of Norse mythology is the
Poetic Edda (also known as the Elder Edda), which contains versions of many tales,
some of which are also found in the Prose Edda. More specifically, it consists of 29 long poems,
of which 11 deal with the Germanic deities, the rest with legendary heroes like
Sigurd the Volsung (the Siegfried of the German version, Nibelungenlied).
